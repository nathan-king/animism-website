title: The Great Spirits
---

The Great Spirits are the vast, archetypal presences that shape the structure of reality. They are not separate beings in a literal sense, but personifications of deep forces that permeate the universe. Each one reflects a fundamental dimension of experience, known by many names across cultures. In this tradition, we draw from ancient Greek cosmology to give them poetic and symbolic form.

While these spirits are grouped into types for clarity, they are deeply interconnected—blending into one another in ways that defy strict boundaries. Their names shift across cultures, but their essence is shared and living.
