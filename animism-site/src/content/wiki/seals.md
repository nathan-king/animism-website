# Seals

A **seal** is a human‑made symbol that anchors a Spirit to a **nexus**.  
Without a seal, a created nexus remains inert; with one, the Spirit’s presence is focused and active.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Seal** | Symbol or mark that links Spirit ⇆ nexus |
| **Nexus** | Physical place or object where a Spirit is embodied |
| **Shrine** | Structure that houses a nexus and maintains the relationship |


## 1. Why seals matter

| Function | Result |
|----------|--------|
| **Connection** | Forms the link between Spirit and material form |
| **Activation** | Concentrates the Spirit’s presence at the nexus |
| **Human agency** | Gives practitioners a tangible tool to begin the relationship |

Without a seal, a created object or site remains a symbol only; with a seal, it becomes a working nexus.


## 2. Steps to create a seal

| Step | Action | Key point |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 1. Choose a symbol | Design or select a mark that resonates with the Spirit | Must align with the Spirit’s nature |
| 2. Select material | Wood, stone, metal, cloth, etc. | Material should reinforce the Spirit’s domain |
| 3. Craft the seal | Inscribe, carve, or draw the symbol | Done with intention and respect |
| 4. Consecrate | Ritual action activates the seal | Turns artwork into a sacred tool |

> Creating a seal is a **sacred process**, not casual decoration.


## 3. Great Spirit seals

| Great Spirit | Seal concept | Typical nexus location |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Ouranos** | Star‑like geometry | Elevated peaks or high plateaus |
| **Gaia** | Intertwined vines in a circle | Forest groves, fertile ground |
| *(others forthcoming)* | | |

These seals are predefined and required when establishing a **Sanctified Nexus** for a Great Spirit.


## 4. Finding a new seal

Most seals are **not** pre‑assigned. Practitioners must:

1. **Contemplate** the Spirit’s qualities.  
2. **Explore** shapes and materials that match those qualities.  
3. **Test** the design with ritual to confirm it channels the Spirit effectively.

Only after testing and consecration does a new symbol qualify as a seal.


## 5. Seal use in ritual

1. **Placement** – the seal is fixed to or placed on the nexus.  
2. **Consecration** – words and actions activate both seal and nexus.  
3. **Engagement** – the Spirit is now focused and can be honoured at the site.


## 6. Maintaining a seal

| Practice | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Offerings | Express gratitude and keep presence strong |
| Regular rites | Re‑align seal, nexus, and Spirit with seasonal changes |
| Physical care | Keep the seal intact and clean; repair if damaged |

A neglected seal weakens the link; a well‑tended seal keeps the nexus vibrant.


## 7. Quick reference

| Scenario | Seal needed? |
|----------|--------------|
| Natural mountain regarded as Gaia | **Optional** – may add for amplification |
| Carved figure dedicated to Gaia | **Required** – seal plus shrine |
| Portable talisman for travel | **Required** – seal consecrated at a stronger nexus |
