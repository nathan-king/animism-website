In this tradition, the world is alive with spirits. Every part of reality—cosmic, natural, ancestral, and creative—is animated by presence. These spirits are not separate deities in the sense of distant gods, but manifestations of relation, energy, and meaning. They may be vast or intimate, visible or hidden, collective or personal.

## A Web of Relationship

Spirits are not isolated beings. They are expressions of an interconnected whole. The boundaries between them are not fixed: the breath of the wind may carry the voice of an ancestor, the light of the moon may reflect a hidden memory, the spirit of a grove may echo the body of Gaia. Every spirit exists in relationship—with others, with us, and with the land.

Across cultures, the same spirit may be known by many names, or many spirits may share a single form. Some gods or spirits in one tradition may reflect a **combination of aspects** from multiple spirits in another—blending elemental, ancestral, or creative forces into a single face. These are not contradictions, but expressions of a living, layered reality.

## Types of Spirits

We speak of different kinds of spirits not to divide them, but to understand the many ways they show up in the world. These types blend and flow into each other, but offer a helpful structure for practice and reflection:

- [**The Great Spirits**](./great-spirits) — Archetypal forces that shape the cosmos, the elements, and the inner life. These include spirits of earth, sky, time, memory, justice, and transformation.
  
- **Local Spirits** *(coming soon)* — Guardians of place, land, and natural features. These are the spirits of forests, rivers, stones, and cities—those who dwell alongside us.

- **Ancestral Spirits** *(coming soon)* — The spirits of those who came before, both within our bloodlines and within our spiritual or cultural inheritance.

- **Creative Spirits** *(coming soon)* — The muses, the breath of inspiration, the flame of artistic expression and imagination.

## A Living Tradition

This is not a fixed doctrine, but a living tradition. As we deepen our connection with the spirits, new forms and insights may emerge. What matters most is attentiveness, gratitude, and the willingness to live in reciprocal relationship with the world.

To honor the spirits is to recognize that we are not alone—that we are part of a vast, sacred chorus of life.
