summary: How this tradition understands and organises spirits, and how nexuses and shrines ground them in place
---

In this animist tradition the world is *alive with presence*.  
Wind, stone, memory, and imagination are animated—not by distant gods, but by spirits that embody the forces at work in every phenomenon.

All spirits emanate from the following principles:

| First Principle | Role                            |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **The Arche**   | Undivided origin — ground of all presence                   |
| **Chaos**       | Open potential — boundless space where forms can arise      |
| **Chronos**     | Linear time — one‑directional unfolding that frames events  |


## 1. A Web of Relationship

Spirits do not stand alone.  
Each is an expression of a larger whole, and *boundaries are porous*: moonlight can carry memory; a mountain can echo Gaia’s fertility.  
Names differ across cultures, but the underlying presences remain.  
Apparent overlaps are layers of one living reality, not contradictions.


## 2. Spirit Classes

| Class | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| [**Great Spirits**](/library/great-spirits) | Cosmic forces, elements, human faculties |
| **Local Spirits** | Landforms, waters, cities, weather patterns |
| **Ancestral Spirits** | Lineage and cultural forerunners |
| **Creative Spirits** | Inspiration, craft, innovation |


## 3. Nexuses and Shrines – the material anchor

| Term | What it is | Purpose |
|------|------------|---------|
| **[Nexus](/wiki/nexus)** | Place or object where a Spirit is physically embodied | Makes the Spirit’s presence concrete and recognisable |
| **[Shrines](/wiki/shrines)** | Deliberate structure that houses a nexus | Maintains the ongoing human–Spirit relationship |
| **[Seals](/wiki/seals)** | Mark or symbol fixed to the nexus | Focuses and affirms the relationship |

- **Natural nexuses** (e.g., mountains, springs) exist without human action.  
- **Created nexuses** (carved images, dedicated objects) become active only when sealed and enshrined.  
- A **shrine** provides boundary, care, and ritual focus; a seal anchors identity.


## 4. Practising Relationship

This framework is **descriptive, not prescriptive**.  
It guides practitioners to:

1. **Identify** which Spirit’s indicators appear in a place or event.  
2. **Locate or establish** the corresponding nexus; seal and enshrine it when appropriate.  
3. **Tend** the relationship through regular care—offering, cleaning, seasonal attention.

The structure may evolve as experience deepens, but its goal is constant:  
to keep our relationship with a living world **clear, practical, and reciprocal**.
