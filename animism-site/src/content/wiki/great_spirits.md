summary: Clear roles and concrete indicators for each Great Spirit
---

In this animist system, the Great Spirits are **living presences**.  
They do not merely symbolise natural forces—they **inhabit** them.  
Each spirit has one domain, one focus, and at least one **observable sign** that shows where it is active.

All spirits emanate from the following principles:

| First Principle | Role                            |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **the Arche**   | Undivided origin — ground of all presence                   |
| **Chaos**       | Open potential — boundless space where forms can arise      |
| **Chronos**     | Linear time — one‑directional unfolding that frames events  |

These three conditions set the context in which every Spirit operates but have no agency of their own.

## 1. Structural Primordial Spirits  
Presences that set basic interaction rules

| Spirit | Domain | Focus | Main indicator |
|--------|--------|-------|----------------|

| **Ananke** | Necessity | Constraint and inevitability | Death, entropy, unavoidable limits |
| **Tartaros** | Depth | Ultimate below, confinement | Gravitational pull; deepest chasms |
| **Aion** | Cyclic time | Endless recurrence | Yearly seasons; tidal cycles |


## 2. Light and Dark Cycle  
Presences governing day, night, and visibility

| Spirit | Domain | Focus | Main indicator |
|--------|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Helios** | Sun | Direct light and heat | Sunlight intensity; daytime temperature |
| **Selene** | Moon | Reflection and subtle pull | Moon phases; tidal rise and fall |
| **Aether** | Upper air | Clarity and elevation | Thin, clear sky; visibility of distant stars |
| **Erebos** | Deep darkness | Total absence of light | Light‑less caves; deep ocean; outer space |
| **Nyx** | Night | Hours of low visibility | Time between full darkness and first dawn light |
| **Hemera** | Day | Broad daylight | Hours when sunlight fully illuminates activity |
| **Eos** | Dawn | Transition to day | Colour shift on horizon; first bird calls |


## 3. Cosmic Frame  
Presences defining large‑scale spatial structure

| Spirit | Domain | Focus | Main indicator |
|--------|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Ouranos** | Sky | Open, limitless scope | Overhead vault; visible star field |
| **Hyperion** | Height and brilliance | High vantage and strong daylight | Noon sun at mountain peaks |
| **Theia** | Vision and worth | Perception of inherent value | Moments of clear appraisal or recognition |

> **Distinction**  
> *Helios* supplies light; *Hyperion* governs its strength at altitude.  
> *Theia* influences the mind’s ability to see and judge value.

| **Pyr** | Fire | Heat and transformation | Combustion; volcanic lava; cooking flames |


## 5. Human Capacities

## How to use this table

1. **Identify** which Spirit’s indicator is present in a phenomenon.  
2. **Reflect** on how that Spirit shapes the situation or behaviour.  
3. **Frame practice**—rituals, stories, or observances—around the relevant Spirits to acknowledge their presence.

This concise format gives readers a definitive reference:  
one domain, one focus, one clear indicator for every Great Spirit.
