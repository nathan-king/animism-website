  Nyx is one of the earliest spirits, born from Chaos itself.  
  She is not merely the absence of light, but the keeper of deep rest, prophecy, and sacred veiling.

  In ritual, Nyx is invoked when seeking dreams, stillness, or protection from visible forces.

  Her seal often accompanies rites of divination, endings, and soul travel.
