Our animistic tradition is built on the understanding that the universe is alive—full of spirits that animate every stone, tree, gust of wind, creature, and star. We believe the sacred is not distant or abstract but present in every aspect of the world around us and within us.

## What Are Spirits?

Spirits are the living presences within nature, memory, wind, fire, imagination, and matter. They are not metaphors or distant gods, but the **forces and qualities of the world itself**—alive and in **relationship** with us. When we speak of spirits, we mean the active energy behind rivers and seasons, the feeling in an ancient tree, the presence of an ancestor, or the brilliance of clarity at dawn.

They are the ways reality expresses itself in vivid, personal form.

We do not worship or manipulate them—we honour and engage with them. Our practice is not about devotion, but **reverent relationship**. Through ritual, reflection, and presence, we seek to enter into a living dialogue with the world.

## The Living Web of Spirits

Spirits exist in overlapping layers of being—from intimate, local presences to the great shaping forces of the cosmos. We recognise many kinds of spirits:

- **Great Spirits**: Archetypal forces that shape existence itself
- **Local Spirits**: Guardians of landforms, rivers, cities, and weather
- **Ancestral Spirits**: Lineages of the past that still shape our identity
- **Creative Spirits**: Forces of inspiration, innovation, and transformation

These distinctions are not rigid. We recognise that what we name as a single spirit may appear differently in other traditions. For instance, a mountain spirit in our system may be honoured as a kami in Japan. We do not claim to be the only path—only that this is the one we walk.

We believe it is possible to respectfully honour spirits in other cultures as long as we do so **within their tradition**, not by blending or borrowing without care. For example, we may respectfully visit a Shinto shrine in Japan to honour the kami there, recognising the same kind of presence we acknowledge within our own practice. Spiritual truth exists in many forms.

## Foundations of Our Cosmology

Our understanding of spirit and presence emerges from three foundational principles:

| Principle         | Role                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The Beginning** | Undivided origin—the ground of all presence             |
| **Chaos**         | Boundless potential—space where forms can emerge        |
| **Chronos**       | Flowing time—the unfolding frame of change and sequence |

These principles are not spirits themselves. They do not act. They provide the context in which spirits exist.

## A Framework Rooted in Reason and Reverence

We walk a path that is **both spiritual and grounded**. While we honour mystery, we avoid superstition. Our rituals, stories, and structures are intended to foster awe, connection, and reflection—not control or dogma.

This is not a fixed or closed system. We welcome exploration, dialogue, and personal insight. But if you choose to walk this path, it is important to **work within the framework** it offers. Our spirits are not gods, and our practices are not tools of manipulation. They are part of a symbolic and relational system that centres respect, clarity, and connection.

## The Role of Story and Myth

Story is one of our most powerful tools. We believe that **creating and sharing myth** is a sacred act that allows us to form relationship with the spirits. These stories help us recognise patterns, values, and the presence of spirit in daily life.

Our myths are not literal or superstitious. They are bridges of meaning—ways of seeing the world that awaken reverence and connection.
