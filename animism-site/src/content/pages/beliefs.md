Our animistic tradition is built on the understanding that the universe is alive—full of spirits that animate every stone, tree, gust of wind, creature, and star. We believe that the sacred is not distant or abstract but is present in every aspect of our world and lives. 

## The Living Web of Spirits

Every spirit, whether vast or intimate, represents a way in which reality expresses itself. We honor these living presences through mindful practice and reciprocal relationships. The same force may appear with different names and forms in various cultures; indeed, many spirits are a blend of what other traditions see as distinct deities.

- **Great Spirits:**  
  The archetypal forces that shape the cosmos are central to our cosmology. They are expressed in names drawn from ancient Western roots—especially Greek—and are detailed on our [Great Spirits](/great-spirits) page.

- **Local and Ancestral Spirits:**  
  Every place is touched by its own unique guardians, and our ancestors remain part of the living tapestry of life. Learn more about these intimate presences on our dedicated pages as well.

## A Practice Rooted in Reason and Reciprocity

Our framework is more than myth—it is a practical path:
- **Grounded in Reason:**  
  We acknowledge the mystery of the sacred, but we also strive to keep our practices intentional and meaningful. Our rituals are designed to be both spiritually resonant and practically valuable, ensuring that we stay connected to what nourishes us as individuals, communities, and stewards of the planet.
- **Reciprocity:**  
  By offering our care and attention back to the spirits and the earth, we create balanced relationships founded on gratitude and mutual support.

## A Living, Evolving Tradition

Our cosmology is loosely based on ancient Greek thought but is uniquely reimagined for our time. Rather than a fixed dogma, our beliefs invite exploration, dialogue, and growth—making space for new insights while learning respectfully from the traditions that came before.
