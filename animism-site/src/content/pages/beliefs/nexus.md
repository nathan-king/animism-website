# Nexus

A **nexus** is a physical place or object through which a spirit is embodied and made present. In our tradition, we understand that **all things participate in spirit**, but some locations or materials become **recognizable centers of presence**—active, relational points where spirit and form converge with particular clarity.

A mountain, a grove, or a spring may be a nexus. A carved figure made from the wood of that grove may also become a nexus when rightly enshrined. These are not metaphors—they are material-spiritual relationships.

## Nexus as Embodiment

A nexus is not a vague energy or symbolic idea. It is a **physical form** that holds, expresses, or anchors a spirit:
- Some nexuses exist **independently of human recognition**—they are part of the world’s living structure.
- Others are **intentionally enshrined**, made sacred through practice, ritual, and care.
- All are material. A nexus must have form—it must be **something**, not just an idea.

## Types of Nexus

### Natural Nexus  
These are forms in nature where the presence of a spirit is strong and self-evident.  
Examples include:
- A mountain as the body of a mountain spirit  
- A spring as the breath of a local water spirit  
- A tree as a dwelling of an earth spirit or ancestor

These do not require human intervention to be nexuses—but they may be honored, tended, or enshrined in appropriate ways.

### Created Nexus  
Some nexuses are crafted or chosen—objects that come into relationship with a spirit through ritual and intention.  
Examples include:
- A carved figure made from a tree associated with a known spirit  
- A stone taken from a sacred mountain and enshrined in a home shrine  
- A vessel offered to a creative or ancestral presence and accepted

These nexuses must be connected in **substance or symbolism** to the spirit being enshrined. Not all materials are appropriate. The object must carry an **aspect of the spirit**, whether through origin, form, or resonance.

## Primary and Secondary Nexus

A **primary nexus** is the original or central embodiment of a spirit—for example, a mountain that is home to a local spirit.

A **secondary nexus** is an object or place **derivatively connected** to the primary one—for example:
- A rock from the mountain
- A carved icon made from a branch of its forest
- A shrine constructed near its base

A secondary nexus may be created through respectful ritual, but it must maintain **integrity of connection**. No object becomes a nexus through will alone. It must be:
1. **Materially or symbolically tied** to the spirit  
2. **Recognized and enshrined** appropriately  
3. **Accepted through ritual and relationship**

## Nexus vs. Shrine

- A **nexus** is the **embodied form** of spirit—a natural or crafted presence.
- A **shrine** is the **human structure** built to house, honor, and engage with a nexus.
- Natural nexuses exist without shrines, but **created nexuses require enshrinement** to become spiritually active.

## Recognizing a Nexus

We do not say that “the nexus chooses you.” Instead, we recognize that the world is full of spirit—and our work is to **perceive**, **interpret**, and **honor** that presence with discernment. A nexus is identified through:
- **Material continuity** with a known presence  
- **Spiritual relevance**, such as resonance with story, memory, or place  
- **Ethical relationship**—one of mutual respect, not ownership

## Creating a Nexus

While many nexuses exist naturally, it is also possible to create a nexus through sacred process. This includes:
- Selecting an object connected to the spirit  
- Seeking consent and acknowledgment  
- Enshrining the object with care and ritual attention

This process will be detailed on a separate page: **[Creating a Nexus](/creating-a-nexus)** *(coming soon)*.

## Honoring Untouched Nexus Points

Some nexuses should not be enshrined or removed. The mountain does not need to be carved; the spring does not need to be bottled. Presence can be honored through offerings, silence, or simple respect—without changing or extracting anything.

---

## A Living Cosmology

The world is full of potential nexuses. Spirit is not rare—it is everywhere.  
But recognition, relationship, and care are what transform potential into presence.

To walk this path is to move through a world where stone, water, tree, and tool may all become sacred—when the relationship is right.

To recognize a nexus is not superstition. It is participation.
